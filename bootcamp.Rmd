This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(curl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Load the data
```{r, echo=FALSE}
gap <- read.csv(curl("http://bit.ly/gap_data_upd"))
```

Subset and Visualize
```{r}
eu_52 <- gap %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe", year == 1952)
ggplot(data = eu_52, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() 
```

Subset and Visualize-2
```{r}
eu_5267 <- gap %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe", year %in% c(1952, 1967))
ggplot(data = eu_5267, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
                           color = factor(year))) +
  geom_point()  
```
